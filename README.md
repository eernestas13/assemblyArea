# assemblyArea
Project where we had to code an automation machine with belts to drop solenoids onto metal pins.

My task was to provide code that would automate a process where solenoids travel along a belt, once they reach an area, a plastic 
ring needs to be attached to a metal disk with a pin.

Further down the line there is a sorting area, where sensors are used to check if there is both a plastic ring and metal disk. If both are not present
they must get rejected by being pushed off of the belt.
